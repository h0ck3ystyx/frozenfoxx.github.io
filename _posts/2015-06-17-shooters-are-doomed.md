The in-game footage for the new Doom (2016) has been making its way out of E3 2015 and I have to say that I'm cautiously excited.  It looks great and seems to have all the things I've wanted in a Doom game (i.e. right about everything that was missing in Doom 3).  It made me realize that I've actually been waiting a very, very long time for a new "Doom" and I started to wonder why that was.  What IS Doom?  What does it mean to shooters?  Why have so few shooters scratched the itch that Doom STILL does __to this day__?  It's pretty rare that we have a game still being played 20+ years after it came out, perhaps there's something to that that's worth examining.

![Such examination, wow](/images/d8f30358efc1b566177130d14b628f85_f29.png)

## What is Doom?

Naturally Doom is widely recognized as the game that popularized and in many ways created the first person shooter back in 1993.  At first it looks like it's about shooting and while true there IS a lot of shooting that's not really the primary tool used.  The wonderful analysis at [http://vectorpoem.com/news/?p=74](http://vectorpoem.com/news/?p=74) did an excellent job of scratching the surface of what Doom's actually all about (and I highly recommend reading it).  Doom is not so much about shooting as it is about *movement*.

If you've played Robotron, Geometry Wars, Smash TV or other top-down 2D twin-stick shooters you'll have a much better idea about how Doom works.  Save for a couple very small, low damage cases enemies use either melee or slow moving projectile attacks which creates an environment where your speed is your greatest defensive and offensive tool.  You can literally run circles around enemies, dodge attacks like a superhero, and better position yourself to return fire.  The biggest improvement over those games is the level design.  The levels generally are more open, though you would never call it open world by any stretch.  Still, no matter the corridor there's a very small subset of times that you are ever denied your movement and most of the memorable levels feature a range of open areas, more cramped areas, and everything inbetween with obstacles to challenge your assumptions on where you can move to.  This keeps you guessing and continually analyzing your environment, looking for the best angle to avoid and return fire.

It's also in the first person perspective obviously but what does this mean?  Most simply it puts you into the role of your avatar rather directly and limits your situational awareness.  This keeps things tense as you're always wondering if you've missed something, forcing you to listen for enemy cues, engaging more senses than simply vision.  This was perfected in Quake but is still quite important in Doom.

Finally the weaponry in Doom is great all around.  Every weapon is increasing in difficulty to use, availability of ammunition, and effective priority.  See, the weaponry in Doom is usually all designed around certain situations.  The shotgun is a good all-rounder, but that's part of the reason it's one of your first weapons you acquire only seconds into the game.  On the other hand the plasma gun is really good for hordes of tougher enemies, but runs out of ammo quickly and has slower projectiles that must be led.  The player can always carry all weapons at all times which means it's not about the firepower but selecting the right tool for the job.

What this all combines into is a fast-paced, active game.  It relies some on reflexes early on but the more you learn about movement, positioning, and weapon choice reveals a newer, deeper game that is about optimizing weapon choice, target priority, and speed as a ultimate defensive and offensive tool.  It makes the player feel empowered because not only is the player given the freedom and speed of movement to go wherever they wish in a virtual world but it allows the player to choose how they wish to engage and solve tactical puzzles.  It's gameplay that feels just as fresh today as it did over twenty years ago.

## The New Contenders

There have been a number of shooters obviously in the two decades running since Doom's splash and there's, like with any medium, inspirations, derivations, and iterations.  Early on there was even an era of "doom clones" where various studios would tweak the Doom formula, artwork, and similar lightly and release it as a new game.  Further on, especially since the releases of Quake and Unreal shooters continued to evolve in complexity and presentation.  So how come nothing else has taken the crown from Doom/Quake/Unreal?

![Eh, close enough](/images/not-sure-if-failed-or-close-enough-thumb.jpg)

Destiny is a very good contender recently.  It's been made in the Halo mold which means it's a little slower, features regenerating health, and allows the player to carry only two weapons at a time.  However, it shares quite a few things with Doom that help make it great.  It definitely understands movement as an equalizer, even though it's slower, and properly strafing, jumping, and running will give you a huge advantage over slower opponents.  It never quite reaches the speed of Doom, but it's definitely not bad.  One thing that's particularly annoying though is that it breaks first-person immersion regularly by switching to third person during abilities, speeder bike usage, and certain other sequences.  Still, it's very smooth and while weaponry is limited it still captures a bit of target priority driving weapon selection, just never to a level that will truly empower the player due to not being able to choose the right tool for the job at any time in the middle of combat (you need to slot weapons in and out at a screen where you can still be hit and killed).

Surprisingly Titanfall is close and definitely a step in the right direction.  The double-jump allows significant vertical movement, the speed is quick but never TOO quick, and the "parkour" movement resembles a simpler, easier-to-grasp version of rocket jumping out of Quake but still provides much of the practical depth.  Still, it, like Destiny, is hampered by weapon selection and the fact it's a multiplayer-only shooter.  The Titans provide combat flexibility and the time-to-kill is not too terribly bad, but many of the weapons in the game are instantaneous (hitscan) which means speed can never truly be a defense or offense tool, only a limited augment.  The levels you play in definitely capture the right feel though as they reward movement and positioning but due to weaponry issues already discussed you're never allowed to play around in the environment to the degree of Doom/Quake/Unreal.

F.E.A.R. is probably the closest we've been.  Quick but not too quick, carrying three weapons and enemies dropping new weapons in each area (a la Halo) does a good job of mixing weapon choice with target priority, and the movement is also surprisingly fluid.  The environments, while quasi-realistic, also do an excellent job of feeling purposed (Monolith did an EXCELLENT job of showing off how good level design could alter every aspect of a game) but still provided a playground for the player.  I've played it a large number of times and every room, every encounter is structured that you can play through it multiple ways, just like Doom.  Unfortunately most of the weapons, like Titanfall, are hitscan which unduly punishes the player in these environments.  Admittedly the slow-mo ability alleviates this to a large degree but since it also slows down the player it removes the speed advantage in favor of thinking.  This forces the player into favoring either "think on your feet" or "tactically plan in advance" whereas Doom manages to strike an excellent balance between the two, never forcing the player to have to pick.

Many have come close but we're still waiting on a new Doom.

## Everything is New Again

So, naturally, where does that leave us with the new Doom?  Unfortunately until the game actually comes out this is only speculation but given we've come this far, why not?  Well the short of it is that it's looking an awful lot more like Doom 1/2 than Doom 3, only the character models seem to share much in common with Doom 3.  There's definitely some interesting changes so let's break them down while remembering that of course this IS just speculation.

### Movement

![Seriously](/images/1a2a5a701595c73d02c2eeee3b1004aa26420a8b4fd1439f67c7559f9976c1e8.jpg)

When watching the first gameplay trailer it starts off slow which is a worrying sign, but relatively quickly the action picks up and resembles the original Doom gameplay much better.  The player is moving quickly but not at lightspeed, the double-jump and ledge-grab mean the player has greater freedom to move through the environment at his/her own pace and in any way he/she sees fit.  This is our strongest sign that id has finally figured out why the original Doom was so immersive and fun:  it's not about realism, it's about being powerful-but-challenged.

Movement even improves when we see the second gameplay trailer.  It's already more evolved and features the player being able to circle-strafe enemies, dodge left and right around enemy projectiles, close distance for punishing hits and increase distance from powerful melee attacks at the player's whim.  These are all excellent and show much promise for Doom's most immersive feature.

### Environment

The original Doom's environment was quite striking.  Running the gamut from hellscapes to industrial complexes, dark corners and bright arenas, and everywhere technology either run awry or existing in unholy fusion.  Without being told a thing it's pretty obvious to the player that something has gone pretty awfully wrong here and they are likely trying to escape or destroy it.  That said, they also had excellent design that facilitated speed as a tool, multiple ranges, and even exploration.

The new footage shows off all of this pretty well.  The first footage shows you very clearly in some sort of industrial complex and even improves on the original game, taking a lesson from later shooters.  When you step out the door you can clearly see there is another section to the complex and a bridge adjoining this section to that section, but when attacked the player decides to pursue that path.  Interestingly though if you're paying attention you'll see that at the end he seems to have come out on the other side, where it looked like you were originally able to go.

![Hell of a place you have here](/images/Tonight-we-dine-in-hell.jpg)

The second gameplay footage shows more of an arena area in Hell.  This is quite beautifully designed, appears simple at first, but as the player starts slaying demons after jumping in boots first (literally, a pretty clever visual pun) we see it's actually quite carefully made to facilitate high mobility in a small space.  The player is even able to retreat through a tunnel, use a spire to alter enemies' charges, and successfully combat foes on multiple elevations.

Both of these environments show us intelligent placement of obstacles, good visual fusion of technology with demonic elements, creating a tense place of horror whilst also allowing experimentation with combat.  While it's dark in tone it's not dark in lighting showing that id apparently has finally grasped what fans meant when they say the original Doom is dark, unlike Doom 3 which is visually dark.  In the first gameplay footage it also appears there's an element of exploration though it's hard to tell for certain without more gameplay.  Still, this is definitely promising.

### Weaponry

Simply put, the weaponry in the new Doom looks awesome.  Visceral, great sound and effects when blowing through enemies, and look like a lot of fun to use.  They also so far seem to have returned to "right tool for the job" with a weapon wheel, clearly quite a few weapons each suited to a different range and enemy type on tap, and the player uses many of them quite effectively against different types of foes (the rocket launcher is great against heavier enemies, the shotgun's great against lower enemies, etc).

![The answer is all the bullets](/images/demotivational-poster-15867.jpg)

We even see a new weapon, the player's fists.  In the original Doom your fists were only good with the Berserk and even then it was debatable.  A rather popular mod "Brutal Doom" which I also highly recommend introduced these sorts of executions.  They're silly but quite entertaining and entirely optional.  It seems they occupy the same role in the new Doom as we see the player does not always choose to use them, once again empowering the player by giving him/her choice.  Since the camera never changes perspective this also helps immerse the player by showing him/her that he/she is *truly* powerful, even capable of ripping an enemy apart if the player desires.  That's amazing stuff for an action game.

Interestingly, so far it looks like the ammo counts are lower.  This is actually a Good Thing (tm) for the same reason it worked in Halo:  it forces the player to think about how to use their guns.  One of the great tools of a shooter is the concept of running out of ammo.  When there's too much ammunition the player can freely use a weapon to spam opponents and it drains a little tension.  You want to give him/her enough ammunition to do the job with some margin for error, decreasing it for harder battles, increasing it for easier battles, and to keep the player constantly aware of how much they have left to spend without it occupying EVERY thought.  

To this end while there ARE pickups in the environment it appears that the player gets ammo and health from the enemies themselves.  While there have been similar systems (even in Doom enemies can drop ammo) it's never been quite in this way.  Since you want the player engaged in combat and not worrying about things outside of it often (given this is a game with a lot of combat) having the enemies drop pickups the player needs, particularly health, is a great idea.  Bloodborne actually has a similar system in that if you get hit by an enemy you can quickly attack them and gain that health back.  It keeps the player engaged and aware of punishment but allowing for some failure without a game over.  With this in mind I personally think occasionally dropping health and ammo from enemies is brilliant since it means the player will stay focused on the fun part of the game, the combat.

### Enemies

![Because regular demons aren't tough enough](/images/41cc52514b6ba5cc0418f5ee92293c19_f38.png)

Enemies' designs seem strongly influenced by Doom 3, one of the aspects of it I cannot fault as it was actually pretty good and maintained the horror atmosphere well.  However, unlike in Doom 3 where they were slow, soaked up damage, and warped in FAR too often behind the player these enemies are fluid, move like real creatures, and seem to be placed or warp in the environment where the player can assess their threat and choose how to engage.  This last point is so important it bears more examination as it's part of why F.E.A.R. is still so much fun to play.  

If you wish to empower a player (which you definitely should in this sort of game) you need to challenge him/her but __also__ place/introduce enemies in such a way that the player can choose how to engage.  In F.E.A.R. for instance almost every time the player engages he/she can survey most if not all of the engagement area BEFORE entering or coming under fire.  This means you, the player, can choose how the battle goes, how creative you wish to be, and when the enemies react it's highly satisfying.  Whenever enemies are introduced into an arena after the player has entered it's always from places __away__ from the player, giving him/her time to figure out how he/she wishes to adjust his/her placement in the room and how to deal with this new threat.  This is what Doom 3 utterly failed at and what looks so promising in the new Doom.

Proof positive of this is to look closely at the second gameplay footage in Hell.  The player starts with only a few enemies and more are either warped in or make an entrance.  Every time it is in such a way that the player isn't denied choosing how to engage.  It means a constant onslaught is tense but never feels unfair.  We even see this in the first gameplay footage with some of the enemies warping in in the middle of combat in *front* of the player, never right behind.  It not only looks cool, it really helps push target priority and decrease reliance on reflexes (making the player smarter, not just faster).

### Oddities

![Context - the key to humor](/images/context.jpg)

Having ammo and health pop out of enemies is a little odd but even the original Doom was quite immersive despite very obviously having certain "game-like" elements in it.  I think the tradeoff for keeping the player engaged with a tongue-in-cheek reminder that "it's all a game" is a good one and look forward to seeing it in action firsthand.  Doom 3 tried a much more limited method with more realistic pickups and it ended up paradoxically breaking immersion instead of adding to it.

The super-slow-motion when changing weapons is rather interesting.  When a player identifies a need for a different weapon for an engagement he/she has already chosen this path under fire.  There's no reason to further punish the player by making him/her hunt for a weapon number or cycle painfully through them.  Because of this id seems to have chosen two options and combined them:  a ring menu for fast access and slow motion to compensate for input.  This is really cool as ring menus are right about the best way to make multiple complex selections in a 2D plane due to enforcing muscle memory instead of cognitive memory.  On top of this, should the player early-on need more time to mentally map which direction to which weapon the slow-mo of the selection process buys the player time.  This helps reinforce that the punishing part is knowing under fire that you need a new gun, picking one shouldn't be hard.  Experienced players will quickly and easily know which gun to grab and will not be affected nor receive an unfair advantage.

I personally like the new music.  The original Doom's ambient music was great and it sounds as if they've tried to recapture that.  It's different, more futuristic, but still appropriate.  However what about all those old classic Doom riffs?  Watching the *trailer* footage they've given a new, very cool heavy metal cover of one of the most recognizable Doom tracks which I think bodes well for the game.  It's impossible to know where they'd put this but if they're smart they'll probably save the classic Doom covers for epic, climactic battles and use the new ambient music for more regular encounters like in the videos.

There's also a whole lot of promise in SnapMap but I think that's going to need a whole discussion on its own.  In short, I think it looks like it's going to return the simple, elegant fun of making maps and modding Doom to the people who love to play it, something the original was so good at but got lost along the way to the modern shooters.  That alone is quite a feat and to be celebrated.

## I Believe in Doom

When looking for reactions on the new Doom footage I've noticed quite a few people in the various comments fields on YouTube, Facebook and the like say something along the lines of, "it looks like a shooter I've played before."  I should hope so.  I really hope the game it reminds you of is the original Doom.  It's possible for it to go badly but so far this looks like one of the first shooters in a very long time that looks like __*FUN*__ to play. 

The crop of subpar shooters (usually modern military COD-clones) for the last DECADE have made me really depressed about the first person shooter genre. There's been a couple of standouts, but by and large I don't have fun with shooters anymore because they make me feel so powerless, so limited, the sort of thing I expect in my horror games, not in my shooters.

When I think of and the golden era of shooters I think about Doom.  I want to __*feel*__ the way Doom made me feel again.  I want to feel quick, smart, and powerful but heroic because I'm also *vulnerable*.  I want to feel like yes, I CAN tear the arm off an enemy who dares to oppose me and the thrill of changing tactics when my guns run out of ammo.  I want to feel the simple pleasure of vanquishing terrible foes with the awesome technological might of violent science that's always just one clip away from being a useless chunk of metal.  I want to feel both excitement and fear as I round a corner and discover a horde of enemies hellbent on my destruction.

I want to believe in Doom.
